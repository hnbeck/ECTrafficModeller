# ECTrafficModeller

ECTrafficModeller is intended to help to create traffic scenarios built from geometric data of streets and paths, agents like cars, passengers and treffic signs, lights and markers. Traffic scenarios should be saveable in USD and readable in USD, OpenDrive and OpenScenario.

Later usage may be for simulation or analysis, but the first step of production will be focused to managing the scenarios and necessary data.

Archtectural decision are subject for change, but the start will be as follows:

- [Processing](https://processing.org) as Graphical node
- [Logtalk](https://logtalk.org) with SWI Prolog backend for Structure manipulation node
- [XMPP](https://xmpp.org) as communication means

Visualisation in Looging Glass Portrait or AR/VR devices is in the plan, realization depends on time, because this is a hobby open source project
